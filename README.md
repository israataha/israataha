## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Israa
### Developer | Speaker | Writer

Fueled by constant curiosity and a passion for learning, I take a user-centric approach to problem solving, paying close attention to the details without losing sight of the big picture.

I'm currently a Software Architect at Vibrant Credit Union leading the greenfield mobile development using React Native, .NET/C#, PostgreSQL and Azure.
